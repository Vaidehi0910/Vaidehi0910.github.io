Education
=========
* Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, (Aug. 2021 - present)
* M.S.(Research) in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, (Aug. 2019 - Jul. 2021)
* B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow, (Aug. 2013 - Jul. 2017)


Projects
=========
* Adversarial Attacks on Medical Image Segmentation Models, (Aug. 2021 - present)
  * Devised a novel attack architecture that selects the best surrogate loss function to perform attacks on medical image segmentation models while adding minimum adversarial perturbations.
  * The architecture was able to fool the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models with an attack success rate of more than 99%.
  
* Defence against Adversarial Attacks on NLP Models, (Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2021)
  * Devised two novel transformation based defences that can circumvent state-of-the-art attacks.
  * The proposed defence overcome the drawbacks of the existing spelling correction based defences.
  
* Adversarial Attacks on Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Models, (May. 2020 - Nov. 2020)
  * Devised a novel attack to breach the state-of-the-art AVSR models by simultaneously deceiving the detection algorithm, with an attack success rate of 100%.

* Adversarial Attacks on Visual Speech Recognition Models, (Dec. 2019 - Apr. 2020)
  * Devised a novel algorithm to perform an attack on the state-of-the-art VSR models with a 100% attack success rate.
  * The algorithm was able to circumvent popular defences with an attack success rate of more than 99%.
