Education
=========
* M.S.(Research) in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, (Aug. 2023 - Present)
* B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, JC Bose University of Science and Technology, YMCA, (Aug. 2019 - May. 2023)
* B.Sc. in Programming and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, (Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2023)


Projects
=========
* SpO2 Estimation from face Videos, (Jun. 2024 - Present)
  * Created a new dataset for SpO2 estimation containing facial videos and their corresponding SpO2 and pulse rate.
  * Explored different rPPG principles, Eulerian and Lagrangian techniques, to extract temporal signals.
  * Designed a deep learning and computer vision framework for remote SpO2 estimation which attained the accuracy of 1.02 MAE on our dataset.
  
* Heart Rate Estimation using Camera, (Jan. 2024 - Jun. 2024)
  * Developed an application that estimates heart rate from the face using OpenCV.
  * Detects face mask with 97% accuracy with CNN model.
  * Used different algorithms to detect heart rate with MAE of 6 on a public dataset containing 150+ videos.
