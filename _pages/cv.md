Education
=========
* M.S.(Research) in Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, (Aug. 2023 - Present)
* B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, JC Bose University of Science and Technology, YMCA, (Aug. 2019 - May. 2023)
* B.Sc. in Programming and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, (Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2023)


Projects
=========
* Adversarial Attacks on Medical Image Segmentation Models, (Aug. 2021 - present)
  * Devised a novel attack architecture that selects the best surrogate loss function to perform attacks on medical image segmentation models while adding minimum adversarial perturbations.
  * The architecture was able to fool the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models with an attack success rate of more than 99%.
  
* Defence against Adversarial Attacks on NLP Models, (Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2021)
  * Devised two novel transformation based defences that can circumvent state-of-the-art attacks.
  * The proposed defence overcome the drawbacks of the existing spelling correction based defences.
  
* Adversarial Attacks on Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Models, (May. 2020 - Nov. 2020)
  * Devised a novel attack to breach the state-of-the-art AVSR models by simultaneously deceiving the detection algorithm, with an attack success rate of 100%.

* Adversarial Attacks on Visual Speech Recognition Models, (Dec. 2019 - Apr. 2020)
  * Devised a novel algorithm to perform an attack on the state-of-the-art VSR models with a 100% attack success rate.
  * The algorithm was able to circumvent popular defences with an attack success rate of more than 99%.

Work experience
===============
* Qualcomm. (Bangalore, Karnataka, Feb. 2025 - Present)
  * Student Intern 
  * Working on building an autonomous system.

* Egrowth Technologies (1digitalstack.ai). (Gurugram, Haryana, Jan. 2023 - Jun. 2023)
  * Student Intern
  * Scraped data from internet markets, analyzed it to produce suggestions for content and net promoter scoring (NPS).
  * Developed a BERT-based NLP model to classify and analyze 200,000 reviews, enhancing semantic search and information extraction capabilities for decision-making.
  * Engineered dashboards using PowerBI to effectively communicate insights from datasets, increasing data-driven decision efficiency by 25%.
